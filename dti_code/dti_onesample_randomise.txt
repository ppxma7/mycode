=8 possible sign-flips.

TFCE (or any permutation-based correction) calculates corrected p-values by ranking your observed TFCE statistic against all possible permutations.

With 8 permutations, the smallest possible non-zero p-value is 
1
/
8
=
0.125
1/8=0.125.

randomise reports p = 0 only if the TFCE statistic is larger than all permutations, which is unlikely with 3 subjects.

In practice, FSL sets all voxels to 0 if the p-value is effectively 1/8 but you requested a “corrected” map, because the limited number of permutations doesn’t allow meaningful TFCE correction.

With N = 10, number of sign-flips =

=
1024

=1024 → enough permutations to do TFCE properly.

Corrected p-values (*_tfce_corrp_tstat1.nii.gz) will now be meaningful.

Permutations control family-wise error voxelwise without the need for arbitrary cluster thresholds.
