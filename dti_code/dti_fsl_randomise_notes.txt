# Before you do this, you need to prep and move things. The FA and MD maps are in dMRI/processed/data/data.dti/
# So you can run dti_prep_moving which moves things to a tbss dir with better names. Then you can run your TBSS analysis. Bear in mind, the MDs should be done separately, and renamed to FA as well.






# For the DTI data, you can run 
# Bear in mind, you will need to check files etc. and designs above
randomise -i all_FA_skeletonised.nii.gz -o tbss -m mean_FA_skeleton_mask -d design.mat -t design.con -n 10 --T2 -V
randomise -i all_FA_skeletonised -o tbss -m mean_FA_skeleton_mask -d design.mat -t design.con -n 500 --T2

# Note, for a pre post design, e.g. a repeated measures / paired test, the simplest thing to do is this:
# You take the differences and then run a one sample tttest between these. 

# make diffs
fslmaths A_subj1 -sub B_subj1 sub01_diff
fslmaths A_subj2 -sub B_subj2 sub02_diff
fslmaths A_subj3 -sub B_subj3 sub03_diff

# merge
fslmerge -t diffs_all sub01_diff sub02_diff sub03_diff

# run one-sample test with randomise using -1 (single-group)
randomise -i diffs_all -o paired_diff_oneSample -1 -T -m mask -n 5000

To run MD, you have to do this:
Create a new directory called L2 (or any other name) in your TBSS analysis directory (the one that contains the existing origdata, FA and stats directories from the FA analysis). Type: mkdir L2

Copy your L2 images into this new directory, making sure that they are named exactly the same as the original FA images were (look in origdata to check the original names - and keep them exactly the same, even if they include FA, which can be confusing; e.g. if there is an image origdata/subj005_FA.nii.gz then you need an image L2/subj005_FA.nii.gz and this file should contain the L2 data, even though it has FA in the name).
Now, making sure that you are in your top working TBSS directory (the one that now contains FA, stats and L2 subdirectories) and run the tbss_non_FA script, telling it that the alternate data is called L2. This will apply the original nonlinear registration to the L2 data, merge all subjects' warped L2 data into a 4D file stats/all_L2, project this onto the original mean FA skeleton (using the original FA data to find the projection vectors), resulting in the 4D projected data stats/all_L2_skeletonised. Run: tbss_non_FA L2

randomise -i all_MD_skeletonised.nii.gz -o tbss -m mean_FA_skeleton_mask -d design.mat -t design.con -n 500 --T2 -V
